{{< typeit >}}
My name is Xitong Zheng, a CIS master student at UPenn.
{{< /typeit >}}

I have been an enthusiastic software developer, researcher and student in ML inference, HPC, GPU and FPGAs. With two periods of internship at AMD, I have gained experience in high performance runtime development for FPGA computing, as well as AI application development, compute acceleration co-designed with FPGAs devices. Recently, being fascinated with those supreme compute power of GPUs and the capability of generative AI, I put more weight on ML inference system that aims for LLM or Diffusion-based Vision model, and keep myself updated of the latest advance in industry and academic.
